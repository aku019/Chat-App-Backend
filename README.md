## How to run it on local

Simple, just clone it and then for each backend and frontend install the packages and start the server. 

Follow the commands - 

```
cd backend
npm install
nodemon server2.js
# open a new terminal and make sure you are in parent directory
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

```

Frontend would start on 3000 port and Backend on 4000.
